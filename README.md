# Arch repo `packages` fork

This repo hosts forked branches of the Arch `packages` repo.

- User mods are applied on `packages/*/trunk`
- Backup and alternatives are renamed `forks/*`
- For the forking procedure, see e.g. https://github.com/bryango/texstudio/blob/4.3.1/FORKING.md
  (to be migrated here). 
- Branches named `*/*FS#*` are protected from deletion as they are submitted as patches to the upstream.
  They will be removed once merged.
